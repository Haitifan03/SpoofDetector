# Business Requirements

## BR1
Business wants to detect and track any drones that are spoofing.

### Explanation:
This is a business requirment because it leads to a project to deliver a solution. As specified in the business requirments slide, 
this business requirement is the main crux of the project the business wants us to deliver. Since spoofing is an inevitability, the business needs
to detect and track any spoofers, so that they can know which information is bad information.

## BR2
Business wants to display 'clean' drone information to their end-users.

### Explanation:
This is a business requirement because this effects a project that will be used by end-users. This BR also leads to a project 
to deliver a solution, particularly to end-users. Once BR1 has been met, the business wants to omit bad information from being displayed
to end-users, only allowing 'clean' drone information to be viewed in a given service area. This fufills the ultimate business outcome of having
a service that displays information about Remote ID Unmanned Aerial Systems(UASs).
