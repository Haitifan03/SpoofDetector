# Business Requirements

## BR1
Develop a robust data curation framework for forensic users that can effectively identify potential spoofing attacks within certain cyber-physical systems.

### Explanation:
By enhancing the security and resilience of CPS (Cyber-Physical Systems) data, this project contributes to safeguarding critical infrastructures and ensuring the reliable operation of connected devices and systems. This spoof detector application will extract localization and identity data from collected drone flight information, and then analyze, validate and return simplified corresponding data that indicates instances of Remote ID spoofing.

## BR2
Display 'clean' drone information to end-users.

### Explanation:
The software application is tasked with streamlining drone data for end-users, ensuring that drones transmitting a spoofed Remote ID are not visually displayed on the User Interface(s). Following the fulfillment of BR1, the application will fulfill BR2 by restricting the presentation of bad or erroneous drone information within a designated service area.
