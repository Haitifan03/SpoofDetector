### Topics Discussed
- How will presentations work with an NDA signing? (Question came up of how our presentations would work with us signing an NDA, we discussed that what we are and aren't able to talk regarding our project would more than likely be a discussion between the clients, us, and the professor to come up with that determination)
- Set group meeting times and days (Meeting for our group will be Tuesday at 4:00pm due to that being the most convienent time for the whole group availability wise)
- Set group and client meeting times and days (Meeting with our client will be Thursdays at 8:30am)
- Our clients are not the typical clients due to them having a coding background
- Reiterated that the clients want us to use this as a learning experience. They are there to help us, if we have any coding questions don't be afraid to ask them. They would much rather a problem be 5 minutes long rather than 3+ hours to find a solution.

### Things Clarified
- What our project will entail (from what we know so far)
- What is aerospace (incase someone didn't know)
- Clarified the importance of reading an NDA before signing

### Tasks Distributed
- Read and Sign NDA's (Thoroughly read the NDA and understand what you are signing up for. Any questions regarding the NDA don't be afraid to ask questions. Email back to CEO)
- Research and touch up on Lisp (just incase) (Mentioned in meeting that Lisp is the language they primarily use; do some research to understand the language incase this is the language us and the client decide to go with)
